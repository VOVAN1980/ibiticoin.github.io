## 2. Brand and naming

- The names **“IBITIcoin”**, **“IBITI”**, project logos and domain names
  (including `ibiticoin.com`) are protected project identifiers.
- You **may not**:
  - Launch tokens, dApps or services that use these names or logos in a way
    that may cause confusion with the official project.

    our explicit written permission.

- You **may**:
  - Fork the code and run your own deployments under a **different name and branding**,
    respecting the MIT License.
  - Refer to IBITIcoin in documentation, research or integrations, as long as it
    is clear that you are not the official project.

## 3. Deployed contracts and networks

- Official IBITIcoin token contracts and related smart-contracts deployed by the
  core team remain under the control of the IBITIcoin governance.
- Operating your own frontends, indexers or dashboards that **interact with the
  official IBITIcoin contracts** is allowed, provided that:
  - You do not misrepresent yourself as the core team.
  - You comply with applicable law in your jurisdiction.
  - You do not remove security warnings or risk disclosures for end users.

- NFT artwork and media files in this repository and related storage
  (e.g. IPFS) remain the intellectual property of their original creators
  and/or IBITIcoin.

  as branding for your own token, collection or project.
- You **may** use thumbnails and screenshots for:
  - Non-commercial news articles, reviews, research, and documentation.
  - Educational materials, provided proper attribution is given.

## 5. No endorsement

- Using the code under MIT **does not** create any partnership,
  endorsement or sponsorship by the IBITIcoin team.
- The IBITIcoin team is not responsible for forks, third-party deployments
  or frontends created by external parties.
