      What if a man could live forever... but forget everything every time?<br><br>
      Or can a man live forever?<br>
      Who? What? Why?<br><br>

    <h3>The Journey of Humanity</h3>
    <p>
      The Journey of Humanity is a literary journey through the history of civilization, 
      told from the perspective of an immortal man who awakens in different eras with no memory of himself.<br><br>

      From the first fire to the quantum leap, each chapter becomes a turning point in the development of humanity: 
      not only technological, but also spiritual, cultural and moral.<br><br>

      Each chapter is a mirror. A revelation. A warning. As the hero wanders through time, 
      fragments of the past return to him - and in the end he realizes the terrible truth: 
      he was not just a witness ... he was, is and will be .... ? ....

    <h3>Chapter 1: Creation (Part 1)</h3>
    <p>
"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. - Revelation of John the Theologian<br><br>

I had no form. I had no name. I did not know who I was, and could not know, for I had not yet lived. But I existed. 
As an observation. As a point of awareness in infinity, in which there was nothing to be aware of. 
I did not know that I was 'I'. But I already felt that I was not nothing.<br><br>

And then — it happened.<br>
Or did it only seem that way to me?<br><br>

What happened could not be called either an explosion or a beginning. It was a manifestation. Light turned inside out, 
giving birth to space. The fabric of being began to vibrate. In the birth of the Universe there was no joy, no anger — 
there was only the fact: 'is'.<br><br>

The galaxies began to rotate. Matter gathered into patterns.<br><br>

I was in every spark, in every stream.<br>
Not as a creator, not as a witness — I was a part. A wave. A pulse.<br>
An unconscious shadow of the primordial heat.<br><br>

But even in this shadow — I felt alone.<br><br>

Millennia passed like a breath. The world was forming. Stars were born and died, 
not knowing that their death was a step towards life. The cosmos was beautiful and indifferent. 
I glided along its structures, getting lost, being, disappearing.<br><br>

And here it is.<br><br>

A planet. Without a name. Without breath. A ball of dirt and heat, scorched and barren. 
But I knew: this is a point. A place. Here - mine will begin. Not consciously, not by will - 
but it is here that I will become myself.<br><br>

I felt how it cools. How the earth's crust becomes covered with scars. 
How volcanoes scream into the sky without stars. How water whispers to the sand for the first time. 
I was in this whisper. In these cracks. In these lightning strikes.<br><br>

“I felt that I was being born,”
