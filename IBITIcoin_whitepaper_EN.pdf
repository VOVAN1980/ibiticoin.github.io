1. Vision & Motivation
Most small-cap tokens rely on off-chain promises: spreadsheets, manual market making and opaque wallets. Once the hype fades, there is usually nothing verifiable on-chain. 
IBITIcoin takes the opposite approach. Everything that touches liquidity, fees, rewards or governance is implemented as a set of auditable smart contracts. Instead of a single “god contract”, the system is built from independent modules that can be upgraded or extended gradually. 
The long-term goal is simple: create a transparent, modular base asset with a real on-chain treasury, sustainable fee model and tools for community-driven governance.

2.1 Treasury-centric design
A large share of the supply is held by the on-chain treasury contract. From there, tokens are streamed over time to: 
•	Liquidity and reserve wallets
•	Staking rewards and ecosystem incentives
•	DAO & community programs
•	Team and contributor vesting contracts
Every movement from the treasury is done via explicit transactions (for example, treasurySend) signed from a hardware wallet. There are no hidden “owner drains” or undocumented mint functions. 
2.2 Deployed mainnet addresses
On BNB Smart Chain the core contracts are deployed as follows (selection, see repository docs for the full list): 
•	IBITI token – 0x47F2FFCb164b2EeCCfb7eC436Dfb3637a457B9bb
•	IBITI / USDT pair (PancakeSwap V2) – 0xADfb9F0f810311e9c01C27B380909A5FfC104Be0
•	PancakeSwap V2 router – 0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E
•	USDT (BSC) – 0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955
3. Smart-contract architecture
IBITIcoin is implemented as a suite of Solidity contracts, each with a single, explicit responsibility. Only the most important modules are summarized here; the full list and source code are available in the public repository. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} 
3.1 Core token
IBITIcoin.sol is the main BEP-20 token contract. It integrates with the fee manager, staking module and other ecosystem contracts via well-defined interfaces. Total supply is capped at 100,000,000 IBITI. 
3.2 FeeManager
FeeManager.sol calculates trading fees for buys and sells based on: 
•	base buy/sell fee configuration;
•	user-level discounts (staking, VIP status, long-term holding);
•	whale penalties for very large sells;
•	volatility coefficient derived from recent trading volume;
•	optional NFT-based discounts.
Final fee is always clamped between 0% and 50%. The contract is pausable and only the token contract is allowed to call state-changing functions. 
3.3 StakingModule
StakingModule.sol handles fixed-term staking of IBITI. Users choose a lock period, earn IBITI rewards and may benefit from reduced trading fees while staked. Early exit can be penalized according to configurable parameters. 
3.4 NFTDiscount & IBITINFT
IBITINFT.sol implements the official IBITI NFT collection. NFTDiscount.sol maps NFT ownership and rarity tiers to trading-fee discounts or special pricing in ecosystem dApps. 
3.5 NFTSaleManager
NFTSaleManager.sol provides a configurable sale engine for IBITI-denominated NFT sales, including: 
•	price tiers per phase;
•	optional vesting or delayed unlocks for purchased NFTs;
•	integration with NFTDiscount for cheaper purchases.
3.6 DAOModule
DAOModule.sol and DAOModuleImplementation.sol implement an on-chain DAO with proposal creation, voting and execution hooks for key protocol parameters (for example, fee settings or treasury allocations). 
3.7 BuybackManager
BuybackManager.sol can periodically swap stablecoins for IBITI on PancakeSwap and burn a configurable portion of the purchased tokens. This reduces effective circulating supply and supports long-term price stability. 
3.8 BridgeManager
BridgeManager.sol is a manager for future cross-chain bridges. It does not move funds by itself; instead it exposes hooks for trusted bridge operators or future bridge contracts. 
3.9 UserStatusManager
UserStatusManager.sol maintains a registry of per-address flags (for example, blocked, frozen, KYC-verified). Other contracts can consult this registry before processing sensitive operations. 
3.10 VolumeWeightedOracle
VolumeWeightedOracle.sol tracks recent trading activity and provides a volume-weighted signal that can be used by the fee manager to adjust fees during high-volatility periods. 
Additional modules include a phased token sale contract, team vesting, mocks for testing and other utilities. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} 
4. Trading-fee model
All trading-fee logic is executed in the FeeManager contract. The high-level steps for a trade are: 
1.	The IBITI token contract calls calculateFee with trade context (buy/sell, amount, user flags, NFT discount, etc.).
2.	The fee manager computes the raw fee based on base settings.
3.	Discounts and multipliers are applied.
4.	The result is clamped to the global min/max fee range.
4.1 Base fees
Base fees for buys and sells are configured by the owner (and in the future, by DAO proposals). They provide the starting point before discounts and multipliers are applied. 
4.2 Discounts & surcharges
•	Staking discount – active stakers can receive a reduced fee.
•	VIP discount – selected wallets may have lower fees.
•	Holding duration – long-term holders can pay less.
•	Whale surcharge – very large sells may pay extra.
•	NFT discount – owning specific IBITI NFTs lowers fees.
4.3 Volatility coefficient
The fee manager can optionally apply a volatility coefficient obtained from VolumeWeightedOracle. When volume and short-term price swings are high, the coefficient increases the fee (within the global cap). When markets are calm, the fee returns towards its base value. 
4.4 Transparency
All parameters are stored on-chain and can be observed directly from the contracts. There are no off-chain or privileged fee paths that bypass the public logic. 
5. Staking & rewards
The staking module is designed to reward long-term participants without introducing custodial risk. 
5.1 Mechanism
•	Users stake IBITI into StakingModule for a chosen term.
•	Rewards are denominated in IBITI and distributed according to APR parameters set by the owner/DAO.
•	Early unstake may incur a penalty which is kept in the module or sent back to the treasury.
•	Staked addresses can qualify for lower trading fees via FeeManager.
5.2 Funding
Staking rewards are funded from the on-chain treasury and/or protocol revenue (for example, a portion of collected trading fees or buyback allocations). This keeps reward emissions under explicit on-chain control instead of open-ended inflation. 
6. DAO governance
IBITIcoin includes a basic on-chain DAO module. It is intentionally simple in the first iteration and can be expanded later. 
6.1 Proposals & voting
•	Any address that meets the proposal threshold can create a proposal.
•	Voting power is determined by IBITI holdings (and optionally, staked balances) at a defined snapshot block.
•	Proposals have a fixed voting period and a quorum requirement.
•	If a proposal passes, execution hooks can call whitelisted contracts (for example FeeManager or treasury) with pre-defined actions.
6.2 Scope
In early stages, DAO control is limited to configuration parameters. Critical security toggles (for example emergency pause) stay under multi-sig / hardware-wallet control until the system is battle-tested. 
7. Token distribution & vesting (high-level)
The total supply of 100,000,000 IBITI is split between several categories such as treasury, liquidity, community incentives, team and early contributors. The exact schedule and allocations are defined in the separate “Token Schedule & Vesting” document and enforced by on-chain vesting contracts where applicable. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} 
Team and advisor allocations are subject to multi-year vesting with cliffs, implemented via TeamVesting.sol. Liquidity and reserve funds are held in dedicated wallets whose movements can be tracked publicly. 
8. Liquidity & market structure
The main trading venue for IBITI is the IBITI / USDT pair on PancakeSwap V2: 
•	Pair address – 0xADfb9F0f810311e9c01C27B380909A5FfC104Be0
•	Router – 0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E
Liquidity is seeded and periodically reinforced from the reserve wallet using scripted Hardhat operations. Allowances to the router are set only for the exact amount needed for each liquidity operation and then reset back to zero to reduce risk. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} 
There is no automatic “tax to liquidity” mechanism. All liquidity management is explicit and visible on-chain. 
9. Security considerations
IBITIcoin is built on top of widely used, battle-tested OpenZeppelin libraries (ERC-20, ERC-721, Ownable, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard and others). The goal is not to reinvent low-level primitives, but to combine standard building blocks into a transparent, modular system. 
•	Critical modules such as the FeeManager, treasury- and DAO-related contracts can be paused by the owner (and in the future, by DAO-controlled processes) in case of clear abuse or technical incidents. 
•	There are no hidden upgradeable proxy contracts with arbitrary implementation changes. Where upgrades are needed, they are done by deploying a new module and updating its address via explicit setter functions. These rights are visible in the source code and on-chain. 
•	Most modules interact with the core IBITI token through well-defined interfaces. This allows individual components to be replaced (for example, a new FeeManager version) without touching user balances or the token contract itself. 
•	Users always keep control over their own wallets. The team does not hold custodial deposits on behalf of users; interaction with the protocol is done directly from non-custodial wallets. 
•	Operational wallets that can change protocol parameters or move treasury funds are intended to be used with hardware-wallet setups and strict internal procedures. 
As with any smart-contract system, some level of technical and market risk will always remain. IBITIcoin should be treated as an experimental DeFi project, and each participant should size positions according to their own risk tolerance and independent research. 
Despite these measures, smart-contract risk cannot be eliminated. Users should treat IBITIcoin as an experimental DeFi project and never commit funds they cannot afford to lose. 
10. Legal & regulatory note
IBITIcoin does not represent equity, debt or any form of claim on the issuing entity. It is a utility and governance token for an experimental DeFi ecosystem. 
•	No ICO, IEO or launchpad sale has been conducted for IBITI.
•	The token is distributed through on-chain transactions, liquidity provision and community incentives.
•	Holding IBITI does not grant ownership of any legal entity, and does not guarantee profits, dividends or buybacks.
•	Regulation of digital assets varies by jurisdiction. Each user is responsible for complying with local laws, including tax obligations.
11. Roadmap (high-level)
•	Phase 1 – Launch: token deployment, initial liquidity, website, explorer data, basic Hardhat tooling.
•	Phase 2 – Utilities: public launch of staking and NFT modules; first DAO proposals; initial partner experiments.
•	Phase 3 – Ecosystem: integrations, community campaigns, bridge experiments and additional dApps around IBITI.
•	Phase 4 – Scaling: more DAO-controlled parameters, recurring buyback/burn programs and long-term liquidity planning.
