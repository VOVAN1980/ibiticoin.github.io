# IBITIcoin Community Code of Conduct

We want the IBITIcoin ecosystem to be a place where developers, users and
researchers can work together respectfully.

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- GitHub repositories under the IBITIcoin organization,
- official chats and forums,
- any contribution related to the project.

## 1. Be respectful

- No harassment, hate speech or personal attacks.
- Disagree with ideas, not with people.
- Assume good intentions, but respect boundaries.

## 2. No scams or illegal activity

- No promotion of scams, pump-and-dump schemes or market manipulation.
- Do not offer or request private keys, seed phrases or passwords.
- Follow the laws of your own jurisdiction.

## 3. Keep it technical in technical spaces

- Use Issues and Pull Requests for technical discussion.
- For general support or price talk, use the appropriate community channels.

## 4. No impersonation

- Do not pretend to be a member of the core team or an official representative.
- Only accounts clearly marked as such should be treated as “core team”.

## 5. Reporting problems

If you observe behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact:

- `info@ibiticoin.com` or
- open a private message to maintainers if available.

We will review incidents and may take appropriate action, including:

- warnings,
- temporary or permanent bans from repositories and community spaces.

## 6. Changes

This Code of Conduct may be updated over time as the project grows.
The latest version will always be available in this repository.
